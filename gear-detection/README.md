GearDetection-kde.ipynb : Script to calculate the gears boundaries using kde.

jenkspy_opt.ipynb : File containing the jenks method to calculate the boundaries for the gears as well as the optimal number of gears.

params_for_cars.txt : A file containing the data for the standard method, i.e. the total drive ratios directly or the gear ratios and the final drive ratio and also the tire dimensions for the cars.

plot_to_check_correctness.ipynb :  Script to plot the gear boundaries calculated using the standard technique and the df_ratios

read_data.py : A basic file to read the data for a single car
